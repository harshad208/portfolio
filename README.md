### Document Text Extract Using OCR

The Document Text Extract Using OCR project is a powerful tool designed to convert images of text into machine-readable text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. This application enables users to upload scanned documents or images containing text, and it processes these images to extract the textual content accurately and efficiently. The extracted text can then be edited, searched, and utilized for various purposes, such as data entry, digital archiving, and content analysis. The interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise. By leveraging advanced OCR algorithms, this project ensures high accuracy in text recognition, supporting a wide range of languages and fonts. Overall, the Document Text Extract Using OCR project provides a seamless solution for digitizing and managing textual information from physical documents.

### Word-Guessing Game

The Word-Guessing Game is an engaging and fun web application designed to challenge your vocabulary and deduction skills. In this game, players must guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. It's a digital twist on the classic Hangman game, offering an entertaining way to improve your language skills while having fun.

### Editable PDF Reader

In this project, I developed a sophisticated PDF reader using Python that can extract and manipulate text and coordinate data from editable PDFs. By leveraging libraries such as PyMuPDF (Fitz) and pandas, the application efficiently processes PDF documents, extracting individual words or text blocks along with their coordinates. This allows for advanced text manipulation and data extraction tasks, making it a valuable tool for document analysis and processing. The project also incorporates custom logging to ensure robust error handling and easy debugging. This PDF reader showcases my ability to handle complex document processing tasks and demonstrates the power of Python for developing versatile, data-driven applications.
